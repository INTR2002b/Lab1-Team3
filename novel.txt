He didn't know why they were there... but they were.As he looked around he could only see dead trees for miles.
There seemed to be a strange disfigured form in the distance, but he couldn’t see it clearly.
With sticks cracking beneath his feet, he slowly approached the faint figure cautiously.
The figures eyes began to glow and smoke travelled out from it’s nostrils. 
And then a frog comes out of nowhere and says “Why you always lying, why you always lying”. 
Confused, Rocco looked the frog directly in his eyes and yelled “SHUT UP!!!1!!one”.
The frog stared blankly at Rocco and began singing.
Rocco put his arm around the frog and together they sang justin bieber’s most recent hit song “Baby.”
